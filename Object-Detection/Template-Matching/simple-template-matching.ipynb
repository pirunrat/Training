    "Template Matching is a computer vision technique used to identify and locate a predefined template (a smaller image or pattern) within a larger image. It is a fundamental approach for object detection and image recognition tasks, relying on finding regions in the input image that match the template."

    "1. Input and Template: You provide a larger input image and a smaller template image that represents the object or pattern to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sliding Window Operation: The algorithm slides the template across the input image, comparing the template with regions of the same size in the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Similarity Measurement: At each position, a similarity metric is computed to determine how closely the template matches the current region of the input   image. Common metrics include:\n",
