This technique is widely used in interactive segmentation tasks, such as separating an object from its background."

    "The goal of graph cut is to segment an image into regions by modeling the image as a graph, where pixels (or groups of pixels) are represented as nodes, and edges represent relationships between pixels (such as intensity differences or other features). The algorithm works by finding a set of edges (a cut) that completely separates the graph into two disjoint regions, with one labeled as the foreground and the other as the background. The optimal cut minimizes a cost function, ensuring that the separation respects both the similarity between pixels and the constraints provided by user-defined seeds or priors."
